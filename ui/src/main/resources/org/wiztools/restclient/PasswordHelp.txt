RESTClient uses Base64 encoding for storing passwords. This is a basic measure to ensure that the passwords are not visible to the naked eye (although this is easily computable). When writing/editing RESTClient files by hand, it might be needed to convert passwords to the format RESTClient understands. For purposes like these, this plugin might be used.
